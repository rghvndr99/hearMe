# Legal assets

Place your static Privacy Policy PDF here so itâ€™s served at /legal/privacy-policy.pdf

- Expected file name: privacy-policy.pdf
- Public URL after placing: https://<your-host>/legal/privacy-policy.pdf (in dev: http://localhost:5173/legal/privacy-policy.pdf)
- The registration page will try to open this PDF; if missing, it falls back to the HTML page at /privacy

Notes
- This repository does not include a binary PDF by default. Add your signed/legal-approved PDF here.
- To update later, replace the file at the same path and rebuild/redeploy.
