recognition.lang = 'en-US';
```

```javascript
const synth = window.speechSynthesis;
const utterance = new SpeechSynthesisUtterance(text);

synth.speak(utterance);
```

### State Management

const [isListening, setIsListening] = useState(false);    // Mic active
const [isSpeaking, setIsSpeaking] = useState(false);      // AI speaking
const [voiceEnabled, setVoiceEnabled] = useState(true);   // Voice on/off
const recognitionRef = useRef(null);                      // Speech recognition
